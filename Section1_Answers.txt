                                      Question 1
===================================================================================

Histogram analysis is one of the most widely used methods to extract statistical information ofan image. 
List and explain five statistical features that can be obtained from a histogram?Provide the formulation of each of those statistical features

There are a couple of methods that can be used to extract statsitical information from an image 

  1. Mean - the average intensity level of the image and indicates overall brightness.
    - Formulation: μ = Σ(i × h(i)) / N 
      - i = intensity level (0 to L-1)
      - h(i) = number of pixels at intensity level i
      - N = total number of pixels in the image

  2. Variance (Second Central Moment) - the spread of intensity values around the mean, indicating contrast levels in the image.
    - Formulation: σ² = Σ((i - μ)² × h(i)) / N
      - μ = mean intensity
      - Standard deviation σ = √σ² 

  3. Skewness (Third Central Moment) - measures the asymmetry of the histogram distribution, indicating whether the image is predominantly dark or bright.
    - Formulation: Skewness = Σ((i - μ)³ × h(i)) / (N × σ³)
      - i = Intensity level (grayscale value ranging from 0 to L-1, where L is typically 256 for 8-bit images)
      - μ = Mean intensity value of the image (calculated as shown in feature 1)
      - h(i) = Histogram count - number of pixels that have intensity level i 
      - N = Total number of pixels in the image
      - σ = Standard deviation (square root of variance)

  4. Kurtosis (Fourth Central Moment) - measures the "peakedness" or flatness of the histogram distribution, indicating how concentrated the intensity values are.
    -Formulation: Kurtosis = Σ((i - μ)⁴ × h(i)) / (N × σ⁴) - 3
      - i = Intensity level (0 to L-1)
      - μ =  Mean intensity value
      - h(i) = Number of pixels at intensity level i
      - N = Total number of pixels
      - σ = Standard deviation
      - -3 = Excess kurtosis adjustment (makes normal distribution have kurtosis = 0)

  5. Entropy - measures the randomness or information content in the image, indicating texture complexity.
    - Formulation: Entropy = -Σ(p(i) × log₂(p(i)))
      - i = Intensity level (0 to L-1)
      - p(i) = Probability of intensity level i, calculated as p(i) = h(i)/N
      - h(i) = Histogram count at intensity level i
      - N = Total number of pixels

                                      Question 2
===================================================================================

List and explain three methods that can be used to capture color properties of an image.

  1. Color Histograms - represent the distribution of colors in an image by counting the frequency of occurrence of each color or color range.
    - For RGB images, we create a separate histogram for each color chanel, Red, Green, and Blue. Other channels can be used like HSV, or LAB
    each bin represents a color value or range of values, and the heigh of each bin indicates how many pixels belong to each channel 

  2. Color Moments - statistical measures that capture the color distribution using mathematical moments 
    - typically we start with the first moment, the mean, to each color channel separately, this will capture the most dominant color tone or channel.
    Then we take the second moment, the color spread, on each channel, this will measure how much each color varies from the average. Last we take the
    third moment, color asymmetry, which measures whether the color distribution is skewed toward dark or bright values.

  3. Color Coherence Vectors - enhance traditional color histograms by incorporating spatial information about the color distribution
    - For each color histogram pixels are classified as either coherent or incoherent, a coherent pixel is part of a large connected region of similar
    color. We then make two bins for the counts of incoherent and coherent pixels

                                      Question 3
===================================================================================

List and explain three methods that can be used to capture shape properties of an image.

  1. Contour Based Shape Descriptors - Contour based methods extract shape information from the boundary or perimeter of objects in the image 
   - First we extract the object boundary or contour ege using edge detection and or segmentation, then we analyze contour points to derive shape
   characteristics, lastly we classify the shape as Chain Codes, Fourier Descriptors, and Curvature analysis

  2. Region Based Shape base descriptors - analyze the entire area or region of the shape rather than just the boundary. 
    - Similar to Contour based shape descriptors, but now we can use 
      - Geometric moments - Mathematical moments calculated over the entire shape region
      - Hu moments - Seven invariant moments derived from central moments
      - Shape Compactness - Compactness = (Perimeter²)/(4π × Area)

  3. Structural Shape Descriptors - represent shapes as combinations of simpler geometric primitives or analyze the skeleton/medial axis of shapes.
    - Skeleton/Medial Axis Transform - Extract the "skeleton" of the shape - the set of points equidistant from the nearest boundary points
    - Shape Decomposition - Break complex shapes into simpler components (rectangles, ellipses, circles) Analyze relationships between components
    - Distance Transform - For each interior point, calculate distance to nearest boundary creates a distance map of the shape interior
